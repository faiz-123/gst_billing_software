## Current Active Structure:
- `screens/login.py` (replaces login_ui.py)
- `screens/company_selection.py` (replaces select_company.py)
- `screens/company_creation.py` (replaces create_company.py, new_company_ai.py)
- `screens/dashboard.py` (replaces dashboard.py)
- `screens/parties.py` (replaces add_party.py, parties_list.py)
- `screens/products.py` (replaces add_product.py, product_list.py)
- `screens/invoices.py` (replaces invoice.py, invoice_list.py)
- `screens/payments.py` (replaces record_payment.py, payment_list.py)

## Safe to Delete:
These backup files can be safely deleted after confirming the new structure works correctly.
