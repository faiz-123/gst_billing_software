	Prevent saving if required fields are empty.

2. Error Handling & User Feedback
Replace print statements with user-friendly error dialogs.
Show specific error messages (e.g., "Party already exists").
Use custom exceptions for validation errors.

3. UI/UX Improvements

Use consistent input widgets from common_widgets.py.
Add keyboard navigation (Tab order, Enter to submit).
Show loading/progress indicator during save.
Add context menu for quick actions (copy GSTIN, etc.).

4. Business Logic
Add credit limit and credit days fields with validation.
Implement party classification (dropdown: VIP, Regular, etc.).
Allow adding multiple contact persons (dynamic fields).
Add party status (Active/Inactive).

5. Security
